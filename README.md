# Pintos

Pintos is an educational operating system for the x86 architecture. It supports multithreading, loading and running user programs, and a file system, but it implements all of these in a very simple way. In the Pintos projects, you and your project team will strengthen its support in all three of these areas. Pintos could, theoretically, run on a regular IBM-compatible PC. Unfortunately, it is impractical to supply every CS 162 student a dedicated PC for use with Pintos. Therefore, we will run Pintos projects in a system simulator, that is, a program that simulates an x86 CPU and its peripheral devices accurately enough that unmodified operating systems and software can run under it. Simulators also give you the ability to inspect and debug an operating system while it runs. In class we will use the Bochs2 and QEMU3 simulators.
